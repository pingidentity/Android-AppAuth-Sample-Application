# Android Native Application SSO Sample Application

**android-appauth-sample-application** is a basic sample application to demonstrate native application single sign-on using the [AppAuth library for Android](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android) from the OpenID Foundation.

This sample application is based on the "example" in the AppAuth reference libraries and will authenticate the user and present the user's subject and tokens on the screen. Options to refresh the OAuth 2.0 access token and to refresh the authentication session are also demonstrated.

Refer to the [Mobile Application SSO Developers Guide](https://developer.pingidentity.com/en/resources/napps-native-app-sso) for more detailed information.
